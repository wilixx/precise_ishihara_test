Notes of workflow
================
First, to generate color pairs which is easier to distiguish by human with normal visual function but the visual dificiency.
The colorPair like:
colorPair.colorset1={ 
                     [],[],[],[],...}
                     
colorPair.colorset2={ 
                     [],[],[],[],...}
                     
colorPair.colorset1_sim={ 
                     [],[],[],[],...}
                     
colorPair.colorset1_sim={ 
                     [],[],[],[],...}
                     
Second, to validate your color on http://colormine.org/delta-e-calculator[http://colormine.org/delta-e-calculator]

To visually check the result.

Third, recolor an quantilized image so as to get a target image. This new image, hizeto can be easily recoginized by normal people. 

However, the people with CVD(color visual deficiency) can learn nothing from it.


Next to do....

To generate an image which can test out 4 type of people with different visual conditions.
